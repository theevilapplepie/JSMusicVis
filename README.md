# JSMusicVis
This is a simple in-browser audio player and visualizer.
It supports a single playlist which you can add/edit/reorder.

Go to https://theevilapplepie.github.io/JSMusicVis/ to launch

Right now there's a single visualization, it was originally written in plain JS then migrated into WebGPU.
With that working, I wanted a UI that was workable for my use case ( loading some files and letting them play while I did other stuff and zoned out watching it occasionally while I was thinking ).

Next step is to make the visualization modular and also have several texture levels that get merged so I can have separate background color, action, and likely some kind of overlay like text that then can be merged into the action layer ( think Geiss showing the current song on change ).

If you want to see something put in an issue about it.
